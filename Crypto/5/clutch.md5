Challenge Name: Clutch

Description:
A highly secure quantum encryption system was used to lock away a secret message.
However, something went wrong with the key distribution process. Can you recover the original message?

Encryption Details:
- A quantum key was generated using a frame-based QKD system.
- The plaintext was XORed with the generated quantum key.
- The result was Base64 encoded.

Encrypted Message (Base64 Encoded):
fjTHOCs8d0CtJ2xHMDR/HKZH1dFOEavavT0X0Q==
