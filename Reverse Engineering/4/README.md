Reverse Engineering Challenge ( Chakravyuha 1 )

I twist and turn, a tangled maze,
Through tricks and traps, I love to play.
A watchful eye may break my spell,
But step too loud, I'll bid farewell.

I hide the key in ciphered lore,
An XOR dance, a shuffled core.
To claim the prize, be swift, be wise,
Unravel me and claim your prize!

Rules
1.No brute-forcing allowed on portal.
2.Tools like Ghidra, IDA Pro, and Radare2 are permitted.
