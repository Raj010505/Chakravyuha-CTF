ğŸ”’ Riddle: The Labyrinth of Shadows ğŸŒ‘

In a dungeon dark where orcs still tread,
A cipher sleeps, its secrets spread.
Keys entwined like twisted vines,
Curves and shifts in cryptic lines.

A random path, a hidden fate,
Mutation guards the final gate.
Through feedback loops and silent screams,
The flag lies lost in shadowed dreams.

Can you break the tangled night,
And bring the flag into the light?
